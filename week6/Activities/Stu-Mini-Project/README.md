# PWA Mini-Project

In this activity we will take an existing news aggregator application and transform it into a PWA that can be installed on a user's device. We will also utilize webpack's minify and chunking features to help reduce the total size of the application.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder and install dependencies by running `npm install` at the project root.

* Start the app by running `npm start` from the project root.

* Once the app starts open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

* Open [index.js](Unsolved/assets/js/index.js).

* There are 3 main sections in this application:

  * A section that allows you to manage a list of topics.

  * A section that displays different articles of a given topic. This page will also allow you to save articles to your favorites.

  * A favorites page to view a list of the user's favorite articles. This page also allows the user to remove articles from their favorites.

### Part 1

* In the `client/` folder, create a `package.json` file either with the command `npm init` or using a `package.json` from a previous activity.

* Using the `webpack.config.js` from the previous activities, create a new `webpack.config.js` file that uses a babel loader and the necessary plugins to transform the application to a PWA.

* Create an entry point for each file in `assets/js`.

* Create a `service-worker.js` and make sure to cache all of the bundle files.

### Part 2

* Take a moment to study the contents of `index.js`:

  1. `renderTopics()` renders all of the topics to the page using `createTopics`.

  2. `topicData` is an array of predefined topics to populate the page with.

  3. `createElement()` allows you to create a document element using the a string of its type, and object containing its attributes, and children elements.

* Since `createElement` is a general purpose function that we can use throughout our application, we are going to create a separate file to keep it in named `domMethods`. By doing this, we will be able to import `createElement` into any component we would like without duplicating code.

* Take a moment to study the contents of `topic.js`:

  1. Remove the `createElement` function and modify the file to use the `createElement` from `domMethods.js`.

  2. Extract the code necessary for indexedDb into its own file and be sure to import it into `topic.js`.

  3. Extract the `loadArticles` function to a new file called API and be sure to import any of its dependencies.

* Take a moment to study the contents of `favorites.js`:

  1. Remove the all function declarations for utilities, indexedDb, API, and domMethods.

  2. Using ES6 syntax, import all necessary functions.

### Hints

* You will **not** have to modify any files that are not in the `client` folder.

* Ask the instructor or a TA if you're having difficulty understanding any of the activity requirements.
