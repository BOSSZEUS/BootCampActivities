## Spread and Rest

**Follow the comments in `index.js`.

1. Copy the `songs` array into another array using spread and console.log what it returns.

2.  Modify the `addition` function so that is uses the rest operator and maintains the same functionality. You should still be able to pass in any number of arguments. Run the code first in your console to see the functionality.
